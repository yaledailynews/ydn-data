    <p>As the semester comes to a close, the pandemic seems to be nearing its end too. Vaccines are going into people's arms and a return to normal life is on the horizon.</p>
    <p>Here, we take a look at how Yale's heads of college (HOCs) and adminstrators talked to students about this defining moment in history.
      <!-- Soon enough, the pandemic will be history.  -->
      <!-- like President Salovey, Provost Strovel, and Dr. Stephanie Spangler wrote to students about COVID-19.  -->
      We gathered all the emails they've sent since the start of the pandemic to analyze the words they used. </p>
    <p>Words on the left were used more frequently by HOCs, and those on the right were used more by administrators.</p>

        <h3>About this project</h3>
        <p><strong>This is a project of the Yale Daily News Data Desk, one of the newest desks that aims to bring data-driven journalism to the News.</strong></p>
        <p>The News gathered 48 emails sent by administrators and HOCs from each of the 14 colleges since the start of the pandemic. These emails were analyzed in R to identify common words and compare their usage. Email <a href="mailto:leon.lufkin@yale.edu">Leon Lufkin</a> if you think we missed any!</p>
        <p>You can find our scripts, code, and cleaned dataset on <a href="https://github.com/ydntech/ydn-data/tree/master/projects_2021/COVID_Emails" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
