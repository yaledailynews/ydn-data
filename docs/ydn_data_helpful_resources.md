Helpful Resources

Below are some resources that you may find helpful to skim over. They're not reading assignments or anything so please don't stress over them ;)

#### Git / GitHub
- [Introduction to Git Concepts](https://dev.to/unseenwizzard/learn-git-concepts-not-commands-4gjc)  
	- This will explain the concepts behind  "Git" (not "GitHub", these are two different things!). I would only read up to "Making Changes" as we probably won't be using branching or anything else more complicated
	
- [Simple Git Command Line Guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) 
	- This will go over the basic git commands you can use in the terminal
	
#### R
- [Visualization with ggplot2](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) 
	- This chapter is a great source to get introduced to the **tidyverse** and making R plots with `ggplot2` if you've had R experience before but have never used the tidyverse workflow.
	- Some other chapters that might be worth looking into are **10. Tibbles** and **12. Tidy Data**
	
#### Python
- [Webscraping with beautifulsoup](https://realpython.com/beautiful-soup-web-scraper-python/) 
	- This will go over a webscraping example with the Python library `beatifulsoup`
	
- [A quick introduction to pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html)
	- This is a 10 minute guide to getting started with `pandas` for data manipulation/analysis in python. As stated in the technical setup guide, we won't be using Python much for actual analysis, mainly just for scraping and other times if appropriate. 
	
	
We hope this is helpful if you haven't had much experience with these technologies! Obviously these won't teach you everything  you'll need to know, you'll find yourself constantly learning new things when you're working on a project. These do serve as good starting points however!
